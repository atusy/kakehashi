# Single Tree Worker Phase 0 Measurement

## Scope

This experiment records one concrete feasibility datapoint for adding a
resident child-process transport hop before the Stage 1 tree-worker prototype
exists. It does **not** measure the proposed worker architecture or establish
that it improves performance.

The direct and relayed paths were:

```text
direct: driver -> kakehashi
relay:  driver -> resident Python byte relay -> kakehashi
```

The relay forwards the existing framed LSP byte stream without decoding it. It
therefore measures an extra process, two extra pipe crossings, scheduling, and
byte copying. It does not include the future worker protocol's encoding,
document replica, configuration fences, queueing, hazard handshakes, or movement
of Tree-sitter computation and caches.

This Phase 0 relay is POSIX-only because bounded descendant cleanup depends on
POSIX signals and process groups. The production worker remains cross-platform
and must use the platform-specific lifecycle mechanisms specified by the ADR.

## Environment

* Final fail-closed collection date: 2026-07-19
* Machine: Apple M4, 10 physical/logical CPUs
* OS: macOS 26.5.1
* Estimated tree compute budget under the current policy: 8 threads. This uses
  Python's logical CPU count and is not a binary-reported effective pool size.
* Release binary: `ccbd8ffd13c4817eda62e1de6f8cfd3eeb3259d0`
  (execution code matches `origin/main` at
  `a1278be5fdff24d109d9e03134c6bdb880577f64`; the intervening change is
  documentation only). The committed attestation archives this clean commit to
  a temporary source root outside the checkout hierarchy, then rebuilds it in
  fresh target and Cargo-home directories with an allowlisted, recorded build
  environment. Before building, it rejects a temporary source inside the
  checkout or beneath any ancestor Cargo configuration. It records the
  Rust/Cargo versions, verbose Rust host/LLVM metadata, native compiler and
  linker identities, macOS SDK path/version, and locked build command, and
  matches the measured binary's SHA-256 digest.
* Parser/query data was preinstalled outside the measured interval.
* Each collector copied the attested binary, digest-verified runtime tree, and
  driver/relay/helper scripts to a private temporary directory before warmup.
  Measured children executed those staged inputs; all collector and helper
  script digests were recorded, and original/staged scripts were rechecked
  before accepting the run.
* The collector removed ambient Rust/kakehashi behavior overrides and retained
  only the recorded path, temporary-directory, locale, and loader variables.

For each steady-state scenario, the harness first ran one unmeasured direct and
relay process, then alternated order across 20 independent measured process
pairs. Cache-hit processes additionally issued one in-process unmeasured warmup,
then 1,000 measured requests; edit processes issued 100 measured requests.
Reported confidence intervals are a deterministic paired bootstrap over the 20
run-level summaries. Percentiles are rounded to 0.1 ms by the driver, so
sub-0.1-ms percentile differences are below its reporting resolution.
End-to-end wall times retain the floating-point `perf_counter` result without
millisecond rounding before analysis.

## Results

### Steady-state request latency

| Scenario | Metric | Direct mean | Relay mean | Paired delta | 95% CI for delta |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Rust small, unchanged cache hit | p50 | 0.775 ms | 0.710 ms | -0.065 ms | [-0.110, -0.020] ms |
| Rust small, unchanged cache hit | p95 | 0.935 ms | 0.780 ms | -0.155 ms | [-0.240, -0.075] ms |
| Rust small, unchanged cache hit | p99 | 1.060 ms | 0.845 ms | -0.215 ms | [-0.360, -0.085] ms |
| Rust small, one edit/request | p50 | 2.835 ms | 2.535 ms | -0.300 ms | [-0.605, -0.005] ms |
| Rust small, one edit/request | p95 | 3.275 ms | 2.945 ms | -0.330 ms | [-0.650, -0.025] ms |
| Rust small, one edit/request | p99 | 3.420 ms | 3.135 ms | -0.285 ms | [-0.620, 0.050] ms |
| Markdown injections, one edit/request | p50 | 6.915 ms | 6.085 ms | -0.830 ms | [-1.770, 0.050] ms |
| Markdown injections, one edit/request | p95 | 9.690 ms | 8.440 ms | -1.250 ms | [-2.700, 0.245] ms |
| Markdown injections, one edit/request | p99 | 11.015 ms | 10.020 ms | -0.995 ms | [-2.530, 0.545] ms |

Batch A reports lower relay point estimates, including intervals excluding zero
for every cache-hit percentile and Rust p50/p95. That is not evidence that an
extra transport hop intrinsically reduces latency: the relay also inserts two
copy threads and an additional pipe, changing buffering, wakeups, and scheduling
around the unchanged server. An immediately repeated independent 20-pair batch
reversed every cache-hit delta (relay wall time +28.1 ms, 95% CI [7.1, 56.6])
and reduced the Rust wall delta to -6.4 ms [-23.3, 10.9]. The batch-to-batch
variation is much larger than a simple within-batch paired interval captures.
These concrete relay results are therefore scheduling evidence, not bounds on
the future worker protocol.

### Throughput-sensitive cache-hit path

The cache-hit path transferred approximately 14.0 MiB of response bodies per
1,000-request run.

| Metric | Direct mean | Relay mean | Paired delta | 95% CI for delta |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Wall time / 1,000 requests | 1178.6 ms | 1050.7 ms | -127.9 ms (-10.8%) | [-200.4, -58.8] ms |
| Amortized wall-time delta | — | — | -127.9 µs/request | [-200.4, -58.8] µs/request |

This is the most sensitive raw-relay estimate in batch A, but batch B measured
the opposite +28.1-ms wall delta. It is neither a lower nor an upper bound for
the future worker transport: the Python relay adds interpreter, threads, an
extra buffering boundary, and flush costs, while the real protocol adds
different payloads, encoding, queueing, and scheduling. The edit scenarios
include a fixed 10-ms delay after each edit, so their total wall times
intentionally cannot isolate a similarly small transport cost. Their observed
end-to-end cycle times are nevertheless disclosed below.

### End-to-end edit cycles

| Scenario | Direct / 100 cycles | Relay / 100 cycles | Paired delta | 95% CI for delta |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Rust small | 1646.5 ms | 1603.1 ms | -43.4 ms (-434 µs/cycle) | [-70.4, -17.6] ms |
| Markdown injections | 2157.3 ms | 2073.4 ms | -83.9 ms (-839 µs/cycle) | [-181.0, 10.6] ms |

The Rust interval excludes zero in batch A, but batch B did not reproduce it;
Markdown stayed negative in batch B (-58.1 ms [-115.7, -1.2]). This experiment
cannot attribute either difference to pipe transport: every cycle includes the fixed edit-settle delay,
parse scheduling, derivation, response relay, and parent/child scheduling. The
real worker benchmark must separate enqueue, queue, compute, serialization, and
resume time before treating them as protocol costs.

### Validated fresh-process probe

The bounded collector ran 20 alternating direct/relay process pairs after three
warmup pairs, with one immediate validated Rust request:

| Direct mean | Relay mean | Paired delta | 95% CI for delta |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 152.7 ms | 194.6 ms | +41.9 ms | [39.7, 44.4] ms |

The relay series includes Python interpreter startup and is not an estimate of
a Rust worker's spawn/handshake time. Stage 1 must repeat this measurement with
the real worker executable and protocol.

### Concurrent captures pilot

A single 100-cycle Markdown run queued captures before semantic tokens, with
each timer starting before request serialization, pipe write, and flush. It was
used as a smoke test, not an independently repeated result:

| Metric | Direct | Relay |
|---|---:|---:|
| Semantic tokens p50 / p95 | 5.6 / 6.5 ms | 5.1 / 5.9 ms |
| Captures delta p50 / p95 | 37.2 / 40.8 ms | 35.9 / 39.9 ms |

All 100 semantic and 100 capture-delta responses per path were successful. The
final driver validated every capture result as the delta `edits` shape and an
advancing `resultId` lineage; no full fallback occurred. The dataset retains
both methods' outcome and fallback counts.

## Interpretation

This raw process/pipe relay did not expose a stable steady-state transport
blocker on this machine. More importantly, it exposed a confounder: inserting a
resident copying process can change scheduling and buffering enough to make the
unchanged server appear materially faster in one batch and slower in the next.
Batch A measured -127.9 microseconds/request for cache-hit wall time; batch B
measured +28.1 microseconds/request. Markdown edit wall time improved in both
batches, which makes a decoupled buffering/scheduling benefit plausible, but
this front-of-server relay cannot locate the mechanism in tree work.

The Stage 1 benchmark must therefore report transport enqueue/copy time and
worker compute/queue/resume time separately and must include independent batch
repetition. A single paired batch, even with a narrow bootstrap interval, is not
an acceptable performance gate. The actual Stage 1 worker cost or benefit may
be above or below any one relay delta.

This result is preliminary and insufficient evidence for the ADR. It does not
show a worker performance improvement, and it cannot detect costs or benefits
from:

* encoding and decoding the actual versioned worker protocol;
* maintaining duplicated authoritative document text;
* worker queue wait and parent resume scheduling;
* fused tree derivation, worker-local caches, or removal of parent-side locks;
* multi-document fairness, obsolete-work cancellation, or internal threading;
* worker memory, cold start, crash recovery, and full resynchronization; or
* hazard and native-segment control handshakes.

The result does not provide a transport-based reason to reject Stage 1, but it
does not justify the architecture either. Stage 1 remains necessary to measure
the actual protocol and tree-data-plane boundary. The ADR must remain
`proposed` until the real `DeriveSnapshot` prototype measures the complete gate
matrix.

## Reproduction

The tail-percentile driver and relay are in `benches/profile/drive.py` and
`benches/profile/worker_proxy.py`. The 20 paired run summaries, execution order,
scenario arguments, environment, and artifact-tree digest are committed in
`benches/profile/results/single_worker_phase0_2026-07-19.json`. The independent
20-pair repeat is in
`benches/profile/results/single_worker_phase0_repeat_2026-07-19.json`. The
separately generated cold-start and captures results are in
`benches/profile/results/single_worker_phase0_cold_start_2026-07-19.json` and
`benches/profile/results/single_worker_phase0_captures_pilot_2026-07-19.json`.
The binary build attestation used by all three collectors is in
`benches/profile/results/single_worker_phase0_binary_attestation_2026-07-19.json`.
Recompute every steady-state table value and confidence interval with:

```sh
python3 benches/profile/analyze_worker_proxy.py
python3 benches/profile/analyze_worker_proxy.py \
  benches/profile/results/single_worker_phase0_repeat_2026-07-19.json
python3 benches/profile/analyze_worker_proxy.py --drop-first-pairs 1 \
  | jq '.rust_edit.p99'
python3 benches/profile/analyze_worker_proxy.py --last-pairs 10 \
  | jq '.rust_edit.p99'
```

The July 19 steady-state section comes from two independent 20-pair collector
runs and preserves every run summary and status count but not each raw stderr
stream. The tables report batch A and the prose discloses batch B; they are not
silently pooled across the observed non-stationarity.
Cold start was recollected as 20 alternating pairs with
`collect_worker_cold_start.py`; every process is bounded and its semantic
response validated. The captures pilot was rerun with
`collect_worker_capture_pilot.py`, which fails unless both
methods return 100 successful responses and the driver validates every delta
shape and advancing lineage. It remains a single-pair smoke test rather than an
independently repeated result.

Reconstruct a dedicated parser/query tree at the pinned revision rather than
installing from a moving `main` branch, then collect a new alternating 10-pair
steady-state batch without hand transcription:

The checkout supplies only the selected revision and declared origin. The
collector fetches the hard-coded official HTTPS `main` into a fresh bare
repository with local/system Git configuration and replacement objects
disabled, requires the selected revision to be in that isolated history, and
reads the expected metadata/query blobs from that same isolated repository.
Every staged metadata and query file must byte-match those official blobs;
compiled parser libraries are covered by the staged tree digest, not upstream
blob comparison. The committed dataset was verified against `nvim-treesitter`
revision
`4916d6592ede8c07973490d9322f187e07dfefac`.

Run the digest command below and compare it with the committed dataset before
using a reconstructed tree for comparison. Compiler and platform differences
can change shared-library bytes even from identical grammar revisions, so the
committed digest remains the identity check for the exact measured artifacts.

The analyzer uses seed `123456789`, 100,000 paired-bootstrap resamples, and
nearest-rank 2.5th/97.5th percentiles. Before cleanup, the recipe computes the
parser/query tree digest and runs a representative direct/relay pair. The
digest covers only the runtime `cache`, `parser`, and `queries` roots, excluding
setup markers and unrelated `query-assets`, with paths relative to the data
directory.

//! Owned, borrow-free injection **discovery** attached to a document's parse
//! result (#529 companion lever — "don't discover twice").
//!
//! The off-ingress `populate_injections` runs the injection query once over a
//! freshly parsed tree and records the result here (regions whose injected
//! language cannot be resolved to a parser are DROPPED from the stored set —
//! sound because a failed load is negative-cached until a reload, which bumps
//! the generation and invalidates this discovery).
//! A later `semanticTokens` request bound to that same tree rebuilds its
//! injection contexts from this owned data instead of re-running the query — the
//! query-match loop (`Q`) is the dominant cost of injection discovery, so
//! skipping the second run on the request path is the whole point of the lever.
//!
//! Everything here is **fully owned**: no borrow of the document text (the
//! content slice is stored as a byte range, re-sliced from the current text at
//! reuse) and no `Arc<Query>` (the highlight query is looked up fresh by
//! `resolved_lang`, so a settings reload can't serve a stale query — see
//! `generation`). This is what lets it ride the
//! [`ParseSnapshot`](super::snapshot::ParseSnapshot) across requests. Reuse
//! is bound to the exact tree it was discovered on by snapshot immutability:
//! text, tree, and regions are one value, so the regions can never be
//! consumed against a different tree.
